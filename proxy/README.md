## Rate limit
To define rate limits, it's necessary to create a file with the limiters available that the ports can use. The request limit of each tier can be configured using `s = second`, `m = minute`, `h = hour` and `d = day` eg: `5s` bucket of 5 seconds.

```toml
[[tiers]]
name = "tier0"
[[tiers.rates]]
interval = "1s"
limit = 1
[[tiers.rates]]
interval = "1m"
limit = 10
[[tiers.rates]]
interval = "1h"
limit = 100
[[tiers.rates]]
interval = "1d"
limit = 1000

[[tiers]]
name = "tier1"
[[tiers.rates]]
interval = "5s"
limit = 10
```

after configuring, the file path must be set at the env `PROXY_TIERS_PATH`.


## Commands
